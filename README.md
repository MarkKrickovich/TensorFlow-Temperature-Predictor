## Temperature Predictions in West Java, Indonesia:
This project includes code and from an introductory course covering TensorFlow.  I have used an environmental monitoring dataset of 23 features, focusing on a prediction of the Temperature Feature.  The dataset is 9200 by 23 before data preparation steps.  The environmental data is taken from monitors in the town Banndung in West Java, Indonesia.  Using TensorFlow and the Keras API I created a Sequential Model with an LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) Layer plus a commonly-used Dense Layer.  The Loss-Function is Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), and the Optimizer is Adam.  I fit the model using 400 epochs, although I noticed the loss function began maximizing to ~ 0.0062 after only 160 epochs. 

I used TensorFlow to Predict the Temperature<br>
The Training Score is 1.99 RMSE<br>
The Test Score is 2.82 RMSE<br>
The Standard Deviation of the Test Dataset was 4.19
